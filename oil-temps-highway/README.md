# Oil Temps with Different Underbody Configurations

## Test & Measurements done
Here I would like to compare the oil temps I observed during highway driving at around 100kph.
The "tests" include measurements with:

* My old oil pan (early model celica - compatible moroso) with and without the rear underbody cover **completely closed**
* My new GPAN3 oil pan without the underbody cover and with the cover **but with NACA ducts**

## Observations & Conclusions

### 1. The underbody **without openings** increased the oil temp by more than 10C ###

Moroso / No underbody:

Moroso / With Underbody completely closed:

The temps with the closed underbody where +10 to +13C higher compared to the open underbody.
OK, the ambient temp was higher than the test above but still it is a significant increase in the oil temp.
This makes perfect sense since there was close to no air flow in the area.
That's why I added the NACA ducts.

### 2. The new oil pan lowered the oil temp by more than 10C & increased the oil press a bit ###

I have no idea why this is happening! Could be the different location of the temp sensor (the GPAN3 has the sensor at
the firewall side, where the air hits the pan) but I do not know if this causes the differential in the temperature
readings (or if the temp really is 8C* lower). Same for the pressure differential, I have no idea :)
Could be a byproduct of the lowered oil temp. But it confirms that the oil temp is actually lower.

### 3. Oil temp with GPAN3 & the underbody having NACA ducts, are more or less the same with no underbody. ###
The temp in this test was actually even lower than the completely open underbody. But the ambient temp was lower as you 
can see from the lower IAT.

So it looks like the NACA ducts work.

Another proof that the air flow from the NACA ducts actually does cooldown the oil is the following:

I stopped on traffic lights, the oil temp raised to 62C and then when I moved again the oil dropped to ~55C again
(red line: oil temp, white: speed).
